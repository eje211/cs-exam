# LVL Studio - C# Developer Exam

Greetings to you, fearless developer!

We hope you will have as much fun answering that exam as we had creating it!

Godspeed! =)

— The LVL DEV team

## Instructions

- Clone the exam Git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/lvlstudio/cs-exam.git cs-exam
```

- Create and checkout an `exam` branch, in which you will be working:

```
git checkout -b exam
```

- Granted, that code is absolutely *horrible*. Yes, I did write it, but I had to rewire my brain completely in order to achieve such horror. Don't expect to find anything close to that in our code, here at LVL! ;)
- The present document is a `README.md` file located in the root of the repository. Answer questions directly in that file, except for those where code needs to be modified.
- When you are done with the exam, make sure all your changes are committed locally, archive your entire `cs-exam` working folder into an `exam.zip` file and send it to us.


- That's it! Thanks for taking the time, you can now sit back and relax. We will review your exam and contact you as soon as we can!

## Question 1

What the heck is this program doing?

### Answer

*Answer here*

## Question 2

What issues (if any?!?) do you see in that code? Order them from "most apocalyptic" to "little less insane".

### Answer

- *Answer here*
- ...

## Question 3

Refactor the code to address most issues you identified in previous question (or, if there weren't any, you may just skip this question… and the next!)

- The code uses a REST API with dummy data, located at `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`. You may want to have a look at that site to help you understand the API, as you may use any of its endpoints.
- You can do *anything* with that code, as if it were a real project you were assigned to.
- Hint: Keep question 4 in mind while working on this one.

## Question 4

Write just a few unit tests for your code, focusing on its essential aspects.

- You may use the *NUnit 3.9.0* NuGet package, already imported into the project, or any other framework.
